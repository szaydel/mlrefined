    "In many modern applications of machine learning, it is not out of ordinary to be dealing with data consisting of a large number of features. This high dimensionality of the feature space not only presents computational problems in the training of predictive models but also makes the learned model harder to interpret by human users. In this post we discuss a classical and traditionally important technique for reducing the feature dimension of a given dataset, called the *Principal Component Analysis*, or in short *PCA*. While still a widely used approach in general data analysis, as we will see PCA often performs relatively poorly for reducing the feature dimension of predictive modeling data. However, it does present a fundamental mathematical archetype, the matrix factorization, that provides a very useful way of organizing our thinking about a wide array of important learning models (including linear regression, K-means, Recommender Systems, etc.), all of which may be thought of as variations of the simple theme of matrix factorization.
