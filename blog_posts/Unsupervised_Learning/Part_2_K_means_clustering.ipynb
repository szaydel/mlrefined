    "The subject of this post is another archetypal unsupervised learning problem: *clustering*. In simple terms, clustering refers to identifying clusters (or groups) of similar data points within a dataset. Generally speaking, clustering is done for one of two reasons: (a) as a pre-processing step and to reduce the dimensionality of very large datasets, or (b) to uncover underlying group structures in data.

    "As a data reduction scheme, clustering transforms a dataset with a large number of data points into a union of relatively small number of clusters. By representing all members of each cluster by that cluster's representative, we can significantly reduce the computational cost of applying complex machine learning algorithms to very large datasets. Uncovering and understanding existing underlying structures in data is another reason to perform clustering. For example, various clustering methods have been applied in the field of Bioinformatics to help simplify genetic data for human interpretation\n",
    "[[1]](#endnotes),[[2]](#endnotes). While geneticists currently do have a good understanding of cellular functionalities of many genes across the human genome, the functionality of some remain a mystery. Clustering gene expression data into groups of 'similar' genes then helps shine a light on potential functionality of the obscure genes by associating them with the well-studied ones within the same cluster."

    "As mentioned in the beginning of this post clustering is usually performed either to reduce the data dimension of large datasets, or to uncover underlying group structures in the data. In the former case, the choice of $K$ is determined by the size of the original dataset as well as the capacity of computational resources available at our disposal. In the latter case on the other hand, there is not much we can do without having knowledge/intuition about the correct number of clusters, but try different values for $K$ and compare the results. Unless in low dimensions, we cannot visually examine clustering results. Instead we can plot the objective value of K-means over a range of values for $K$, producing a so-called *scree plot*.  "

Notice, the scree plot above has an *elbow* at $K=3$, meaning that increasing the number of clusters from $3$ to $4$ and onwards reduces the objective value by very little.
