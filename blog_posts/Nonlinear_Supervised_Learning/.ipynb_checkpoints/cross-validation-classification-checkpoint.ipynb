    "n the previous chapter we saw how using more basis elements generally results in a better approximation of a continuous function. However, as we saw with regression in Section 5.3, while it is true that our approximation of a dataset itself improves as we add more basis features, this can substantially decrease our estimation of the underly- ing data generating function (a phenomenon referred to as overfitting). Unfortunately, the same overfitting problem presents itself in the case of classification as well. Sim- ilarly to regression, in the ideal classification scenario discussed in Section 6.1 using more basis elements generally improves our approximation. However, in general in- stances of classification, analogous to what we saw with regression, adding more basis features (increasing M) can result in fitting closely to the data we have while poorly to the underlying function (a phenomenon once again referred to as overfitting)."

For each dataset we show the resulting fit provided by both a degree 2 and a degree 5 polynomial (shown in black and green respectively). While the degree 2 features produce a classifier in each case that closely matches the true boundary, the higher degree 5 polynomial creates an overfitting classifier which encapsulates mislabeled points outside of the half circle boundary of the true function, leading to a poorer representation."

    "Analogous to regression, in the case of classification ideally we would like to choose a number M of basis features so that the corresponding learned representation matches the true data generating indicator function as well as possible. Of course because we only have access to this true function via (potentially) noisy samples, this goal must be pursued based solely on the data. Therefore once again we aim to choose M such that the corresponding model fits both the data we currently have, as well as the data we might receive in the future. Because we do not have access to any future data points this intuitively directs us to employ cross-validation, where we tune M, so that the corresponding model fits well to an unseen portion of our original data (i.e., the testing set)."
